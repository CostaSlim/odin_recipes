    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p><em>I bet you wouldn’t think a pizza without cheese could be one of the best types of pizza! But you would be wrong. Pizza Marinara is a classic Neapolitan pizza, and probably the first style of pizza served in Naples.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>One pizza dough ball</li>
            <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
            <li>1-2 sliced cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>5g of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>A small drizzle of dried oregano</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Stretch out the pizza dough.</li>
            <li>Spread the sauce evenly throughout the pizza base using a spoon starting from the center of the pizza. Make sure to leave half an inch at the edge of the pizza without sauce to create a nice edge (“cornicione”) that will puff up in the oven.</li>
            <li>Add the slices of garlic evenly throughout the pizza.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle over some dried oregano</li>
            <li>Drizzle over the olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza for 60-90 seconds at 850°F (450°C). Alternatively, bake on a preheated pizza steel in your home oven for 4-8 minutes at the hottest setting.</li>
        </ol>
